== Dishes

Heavily under construction... see TODO for a couple things being considered.
Anything can and will change at any time.

The gist of it: Dishes is an asynchronous framework that mirrors the mechanics of
BOSH, allowing a client to make requests on one connection and recieve results
on another. Each request connection is quickly terminated so it can be reused
without hitting a resource cap (in particular IE's limit of two active
connections).

See examples/basic.ru for the current target syntax/feature-set. It's
practically guaranteed not to work at this time, but it paints a pretty picture.

The name "Dishes" is an extraordinarily lame pun. "Asynchronous" sounds like it
has a "sink" in it, and sinks contain dishes. See, I told you it was lame.
